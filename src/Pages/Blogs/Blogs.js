                <p className='fs-2'><b>Differences between SQL and NoSQL databases?</b></p>
                <p className='fs-4'><b>Ans:</b><br />
                    <b>Type</b>: <p>SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.</p>
                    <br />
                    <b>Language:</b> SQL databases defines and manipulates data based structured query language (SQL). A NoSQL database has dynamic schema for unstructured data. Data is stored in many ways which means it can be document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based or organized as a KeyValue store.
                    <br />
                    <b>The Scalability:</b> In almost all situations SQL databases are vertically scalable. This means that you can increase the load on a single server by increasing things like RAM, CPU or SSD. But on the other hand NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. This means that you handle more traffic by sharding, or adding more servers in your NoSQL database
                    <br />
                    <b>The Structure:</b> SQL databases are table-based on the other hand NoSQL databases are either key-value pairs, document-based, graph databases or wide-column stores.

                <p className='fs-2'><b>What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work?</b></p>
                <p className='fs-4'><b>Ans:</b><br />
                    <b>Answer:</b> JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued. JWT transmites information between two parties .What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted. It's based on three parts, header, playload and the signature. Once these three gets matched user gets decoded information and access to specific route.The main purpose is to make sure of authentication and verfied user.</p>

                <p className=' fs-2'><b>Differences between javascript and nodejs ?</b></p>
                <p className='fs-4'><b>Ans:</b> <p>Javascript is a programming language that is used for writing scripts on the website. Where, NodeJS is a Javascript runtime environment.Javascript can only be run in the browsers. Where,We can run Javascript outside the browser with the help of NodeJS.It is basically used on the client-side. Where node is mostly used on the server-side. Javascript is used in frontend development. Nodejs is used in server-side development.</p></p>
